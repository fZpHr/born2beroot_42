## Born2BeRoot

In the Born2BeRoot project, I performed various system administration tasks on a Debian-based operating system. This included user management, disk partitioning, package installation, and configuration of network services.

*For more information, please refer to the subject in the git.*

For the mandatory part of the project, I also implemented a monitoring script to track system resource usage and generate reports.

For the bonus part, in addition to the monitoring script, I set up Fail2Ban to enhance server security by protecting against brute-force attacks. Furthermore, I implemented a website hosted on the server to demonstrate additional functionality and security measures.
